## Danceability

Danceability  - ranging from 0 to 1 - the Oasis tracks seem to mostly fall around the 0.3 to 0.45 for danceability. Spotify gives Saturday Night Fever, Bee Gees, a danceability rating of 0.73 and Dancing Queen, ABBA, a danceability rating of 0.54. Going on these figures I'd suggest that most of the Oasis tracks are fairly danceable.


### Top 3 Oasis Tracks for Danceability:


| Track Name                        | Album Name                    |  Danceability Score |
